  "aboutUsText_2": "Grupo 1 had always loved crowded ISEP with its colorful, confused computers. It was a place where he felt sleepy. He was a deranged, forgetful, port drinker with feathery feet and fragile hands. His friends saw him as a hissing, hot hard-worker. Once, he had even revived a dying, baby bird. That's the sort of man he was. Grupo 1 walked over to the window and reflected on his picturesque surroundings. The rain hammered like working humming birds. Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of CAMUL . CAMUL was a clumsy doctor with beautiful feet and pretty hands.",
  "aboutUsText_3":"Grupo 1 gulped. He was not prepared for CAMUL. As Grupo 1 stepped outside and CAMUL came closer, he could see the grotesque glint in his eye. CAMUL gazed with the affection of 7545 loving gigantic goldfish. He said, in hushed tones, 'I love you and I want Good grade.' Grupo 1 looked back, even more irritable and still fingering the giant sandwich. 'CAMUL, I like this,' he replied. They looked at each other with tired feelings, like two gigantic, glorious guppies partying at a very stupid class, which had piano music playing in the background and two witty uncles running to the beat. Grupo 1 regarded CAMUL's beautiful feet and pretty hands. 'I feel the same way!' revealed Grupo with a delighted grin. CAMUL looked active, his emotions blushing like a great, gifted gun. Then CAMUL came inside for a nice glass of port. THE END",
